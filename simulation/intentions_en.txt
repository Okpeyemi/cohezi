# 🧪 Intentions Simulation (Test Cases)

Use these scenarios to test Cohezi's analysis depth.

---

## 1. Strategic Pivot (Business)
**Decision**: Abandon our current SaaS model to switch to an "Open Core" model with premium services.
**Reasoning**: SaaS growth is stagnating at 5%. Our open-source competitors are gaining market share. By opening the core, we create an ecosystem. We will monetize via enterprise support and advanced security modules. Risk of immediate revenue loss but gain in long-term domination.

## 2. Radical Career Choice (Personal)
**Decision**: Quit my job as a Senior Engineer at Google to launch an autonomous permaculture farm in Ardèche.
**Reasoning**: Crisis of meaning. Latent burnout. I have €200k in savings. I want to prove that a low-carbon lifestyle model is viable and rewarding. My family is skeptical about financial stability, but I believe food resilience is worth more than stock shares.

## 3. AI Ethical Dilemma (Technical)
**Decision**: Deploy a resume sorting algorithm that explicitly ignores university names to favor diversity.
**Reasoning**: School prestige is a proxy for social privilege, not talent. By removing this signal, we force recruiters to look at actual projects. Risk of lowering "perceived quality" of recruits in the short term among traditional managers, but vital for inclusive innovation.

---

## 4. Geographic Expansion (Scaling)
**Decision**: Launch our services in Japan without a local office, solely via distribution partners.
**Reasoning**: Structural costs too high for a proper subsidiary. The Japanese market is complex. Partners know the cultural codes. We lose control over brand image but we reduce financial risk by 80%.
