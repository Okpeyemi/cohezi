# 🎤 Cohezi Pitch (1 Minute)

**The Hook (0:00 - 0:10)**
"Hello everyone.
Today, AI can write, code, draw... but can it help us **think**?
The problem with current chatbots is that they are complacent. They are 'Yes-men'. They validate your ideas, even the bad ones. For a decision-maker, this is dangerous."

**The Solution: Cohezi (0:10 - 0:30)**
"That's why I created **Cohezi**.
Cohezi is not an assistant, it's your personal **Red Team**.
Imagine having a board of directors composed of 5 specialized AI agents — a Logician, a Risk Expert, a Skeptic, etc. — all dedicated to one thing: finding the flaws in your reasoning before it's too late."

**The Demo / How It Works (0:30 - 0:50)**
"Everything happens in our **'Cognitive Triptych'** interface, fully driven by **Gemini 3 Pro** and **Gemini 3 Flash**:
1.  **The Intention**: The model initiates the analysis and structures your hypothesis.
2.  **The Arena**: It orchestrates agents to debate and map out consequences.
3.  **The Verdict**: It generates the final synthesis and a robustness score."

**Conclusion & Tech (0:50 - 1:00)**
"Powered by the reasoning capability of **Gemini 3 Pro**, the speed of **Gemini 3 Flash**, and an ultra-smooth **Next.js** interface, Cohezi transforms abstract thought into concrete strategy.
Stop seeking approval. With Cohezi, seek the truth."
